# ICA8_Testing
In men's public toilets with urinals, there is this unwritten rule that you leave at least one urinal free between you and
the next person peeing. For example, if there are 3 urinals and one person is already peeing in the left one, you will
choose the urinal on the right and not the one in the middle. That means that a maximum of 3 people can pee at the
same time on public toilets with 5 urinals when following this rule (Only 2 if the first-person pees into urinal 2 or 4).


When there is already a mistake in the input string (for example  011 ), then return  -1.  
if there is any other mistake (for example 01A), then return -1.

urinals.dat is in "src/main/resources/urinals.dat"
rule file will be generated in same resources folder i.e. src/main/resources
The Latest rule file will always be rule+counter+.txt
if resource file contains rule.txt,rule1.txt,rule2.txt and user run this code again from file input,
then new rule file will be rule3.txt
